# Discovery Piscine - Cybersecurity

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Discovery Piscine - Cybersecurity** repository! This project is part of a cybersecurity learning journey designed to introduce participants to fundamental concepts and practical challenges in the field of cybersecurity. The repository is structured into multiple exercises and cells, each focusing on specific aspects of cybersecurity, including scripting, file manipulation, and security principles.

The exercises are organized into cells (`cell00`, `cell01`, `cell02`, etc.), each containing tasks that progressively build knowledge and skills. The challenges often involve discovering hidden flags, analyzing scripts, and understanding security vulnerabilities.

## Structure

The repository is divided into the following main components:

### 1. **Basics**
   - Contains introductory scripts like `message.sh`, which demonstrates basic Bash scripting concepts such as argument validation, loops, and error handling.

### 2. **Cells**
   - **Cell00**: Focuses on introductory challenges, including discovering flags and analyzing simple text files.
   - **Cell01**: Introduces more advanced challenges, such as brute force concepts and path traversal vulnerabilities.
   - **Cell02**: Explores hexadecimal encoding and other cryptographic concepts.

Each cell contains subdirectories (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, etc.), which house individual exercises. These exercises often include `flag.txt` files containing hidden messages or clues that participants must uncover.

### 3. **Flags**
   - The `flag.txt` files scattered across the repository contain hidden messages or codes. These flags are part of the challenges and require participants to apply cybersecurity techniques to retrieve them.

## Competencies Developed

By working through this project, participants will develop the following competencies:

- **Bash Scripting**: Understanding and writing scripts to automate tasks and solve challenges.
- **File Manipulation**: Navigating file systems, reading and analyzing files, and extracting useful information.
- **Cybersecurity Principles**: Learning about vulnerabilities such as brute force attacks, path traversal, and encoding techniques.
- **Problem-Solving**: Applying logical thinking and technical skills to uncover hidden flags and solve challenges.
- **Attention to Detail**: Carefully analyzing files and scripts to identify clues and solve exercises.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant cell and exercise directory to begin solving challenges.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each exercise and use the scripts or files as needed.

## Getting Started

To start, explore the `basics` directory and run the `message.sh` script to familiarize yourself with Bash scripting. Then, move on to the challenges in the `cell00` directory and progress through the exercises.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a Linux environment to run the scripts and solve the challenges effectively.
- Pay close attention to the contents of `flag.txt` files, as they often contain clues or solutions.

## Conclusion

This project is an excellent opportunity to dive into the world of cybersecurity, learn practical skills, and develop problem-solving abilities. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, the exercises are designed to challenge and enhance your understanding of cybersecurity concepts.

Happy hacking!
